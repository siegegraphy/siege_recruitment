  uniqueAbility: "UniqueAbilities/V3 SCANNING SONAR.png",

  description: `Battalion can activate a pulsing sonar that emanates from both himself and allied attackers. Once the ability is activated, he receives a scan of all attackers’ surroundings within a 5-meter radius around their positions, even through surfaces. The scan reveals terrain layout, including destroyed areas, deployed gadgets, and defender positions. Other attackers cannot see the scan.

The ability is fuel-based and provides up to 20 scans, refreshing every 3 seconds, over a duration of 60 seconds. It can be paused and resumed at any time, but fuel consumption does not regenerate once spent.

When the ability is active, each sonar pulse causes Battalion to emit a distinctive sound, alerting nearby defenders to his presence.

Eliminated attackers drop small devices on the floor that will continue to emit scans when the ability is activated. These devices can be destroyed to limit attackers’ intel.

Attackers and dropped devices within the range of a Signal Disruptor or a Zoto Canister will not emit scans.
Attackers and dropped devices actively emitting scans are detectable by Solis.

This ability allows Battalion to detect enemy setups and serves as a faster alternative to drones. The 5-meter radius around each attacker may not seem large, but with good team positioning, scans can collectively cover wide areas of the map. Since teammates emit no sound and Battalion is the only one who can see the scans, the ability rewards coordinated teamplay with stealthy intel. Although it has no range limit, using it too far from allies may make it harder to notice and accurately interpret the scanned area.
