  description: `Antique is equipped with directional explosive charges that can be manually deployed on walls, floors, and furniture. Each charge can operate in one of two configurations: Breach Charge Mode or Directional Mine Mode.

Breach Charge Mode
Charges in this mode may only be deployed on destructible surfaces. The blast direction is oriented toward the attached surface. Antique can remotely trigger all deployed breach charges, causing them to detonate simultaneously after a 6-second delay.
A single charge is capable of destroying a soft surface. If at least two charges are placed nearby, their explosive force stacks, enabling the breaching of reinforced surfaces.

Directional Mine Mode
When deployed in this mode, the charge’s blast is directed away from the surface. Directional mines cannot be remotely triggered. Instead, they emit visible laser beams that, when intersected by a defender, detonate the charge automatically.

Charges are fully destructible.
Before activation, Antique may retrieve deployed charges for later redeployment.
