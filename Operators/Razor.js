  description: `Portable Automatic Laser Cutter - P.A.L.C.

Razor carries a device that, once deployed, cuts defined shapes into soft or reinforced walls, allowing for new lines of sight or entry points. Before placing the device, the player selects the cutting pattern from the available options:
  - Large Hole - removes a section of the wall, creating an opening that can be crouched through or vaulted, placed anywhere on the wall. 
  - Fire Hole - cuts a horizontal slit too small for a player to pass through, which can be placed anywhere on the wall. 
  - Passage - creates either a doorway or a window (depending on whether the player is looking down or straight ahead). Unlike the previous options, passages always appear in the center of the wall. These openings behave like standard ones: they can be barricaded, blocked with a deployable shield, or combined with the abilities of operators such as Castle, Kapkan, or Aruni.
 *- P.A.L.C. can also be used on hatches, completely destroying them regardless of the selected mode.

Once the shape is chosen, Razor deploys the P.A.L.C. on the ground in front of a wall. The device automatically cuts through the wall for 12 seconds. After finishing, it deactivates and remains on the floor, allowing Razor to pick it up and redeploy it elsewhere. It can also be retrieved before finishing to recover the charge, but this completely cancels the cutting process.

Razor starts with 3 P.A.L.C. devices.

Interactions:
- P.A.L.C. can be destroyed by bullets, explosions, melee attacks, Twitch’s, Zero’s or Maestro’s lasers and electricity.
- EMP temporarily disables the device, but it resumes cutting once the effect ends.
- A Mute Jammer hacked by Brava will disable the device.
- Tubarão’s Zoto Canister will temporarily freeze the device.
- Detectable by IQ.
- Destroyed if hacked by Brava.
- Doorways and windows created by P.A.L.C. interact with: Wooden Barricade, Deployable Shield, Castle Barricade, Kapkan EDDs, Osa’s Talon Shield, Aruni’s Surya Gate, Rauora’s D.O.M. Panel, and Skopós’ Inactive Robot Shield.
