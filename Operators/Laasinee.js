  description: `Unique Ability: Spiderling Mine Transporter

Laasinee deploys a spider-shaped drone that can be controlled like a regular drone. It can move on any surface, including floors, walls, ceilings, and furniture. However, it cannot jump and lacks a speed boost function like standard drones.
In addition to serving as a camera, the Spiderling can pick up and transport small, soft-mounted gadgets from both defenders and attackers.

Supported Gadgets 
- Defender Gadgets: Smoke's Remote Gas Grenade, Valkyrie’s Black Eye, Echo’s Yokai, Lesion’s GU, Ela’s Grzmot Mine, Alibi’s Prisma, Kaid’s Electroclaw, Mozzie’s Pest, Wamai’s Mag-NET, Thorn’s Razorbloom, Azami’s Kiba Barrier (only if the kunai bounces off a player or gadget and lands on the ground without activating), Fenrir’s F-Natt Dread Mine, Nitro Cell, Proximity Alarm
- Attacker Gadgets: Thatcher’s EMP Grenade, A single grenade from Fuze's Cluster Charge, Twitch’s Shock Drone, A single X-Kairos pellet from Hibana, Ying’s Candela (only if thrown), Nomad’s Airjab, Ace’s S.E.L.M.A. (only if it lands on a non-destructible surface and does not activate), Sens’ R.O.U. Projector Disc, Brava’s Kludge Drone, Frag Grenade, Stun Grenade, Smoke Grenade, Regular Drones

The Spiderling cannot pick up:
- Large gadgets (e.g., Frost's Welcome Mat, Jäger's ADS)
- Hard-mounted gadgets (e.g., Kapkan’s EDD, Rauora's D.O.M. Panel)
- Impact-based gadgets (e.g., Impact Grenades, Zofia’s Grenades)

The Spiderling cannot activate or trigger the explosion of any gadget it picks up.
- Proximity-based gadgets (e.g., Grzmot Mine, Airjab) will still trigger when an enemy enters their range.
- Player-activated gadgets (e.g., Smoke Canister, Nitro Cell) must still be activated by the player who deployed them.
- Timed gadgets (e.g., EMP Grenade, Frag Grenade) can be picked up if done quickly, but their timer will not stop or reset.

The Spiderling can carry only one item at a time and can drop it at any moment.
  
Destruction: 
- The Spiderling can be destroyed by gunfire, melee, explosives, and enemy gadgets. 
- If the gadget being carried explodes, it destroys the Spiderling. 
- It is not destroyed by non-damaging explosions (e.g., Grzmot, Airjab). 
- The Spiderling and the carried gadget have separate hitboxes: 
  - If the gadget is destroyed (e.g., shot), the Spiderling remains intact. 
  - If the Spiderling is destroyed, the gadget is dropped on the ground.

- Can be shot by Twitch’s Shock Drone
